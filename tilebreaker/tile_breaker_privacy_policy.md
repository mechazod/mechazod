3. Transfer of your Information out of the EEA

No matter where you are located, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of your information in and to the U.S., and other countries, in accordance with this privacy policy and the privacy policies of third parties with whom we share your Personal Information. The laws of the U.S. and other countries governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live.

If you would like further information, please contact us (see “How to contact us” below).

4. EU Residents - Your Rights
Under the laws of some jurisdictions, including the General Data Protection Regulation in the EEA, you have a number of important rights with regard to your Personal Information. 

By law, you can ask us what information we hold about you, and you can ask us to correct it if it is inaccurate. If we have asked for your consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw that consent at any time.

If we are processing your personal data for reasons of consent or to fulfill a contract, you can ask us to give you a copy of the information in a machine-readable format so that you can transfer it to another provider.

If we are processing your personal data for reasons of consent or legitimate interest, you can request that your data be erased. 

You have the right to ask us to stop using your information for a period of time, if you believe we are not doing so lawfully.

Finally, in some circumstances, you can ask us not to reach decisions affecting you using automated processing or profiling.

For further information on each of those rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on individuals rights under the General Data Protection Regulation.

If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please follow the instructions in Section 6 below and email us at mejiamariano8.08@gmail.com.

If you would like to unsubscribe from any email communication from us, you can also click on the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the email. It may take a few days for this to take effect.

5. California Residents – Your Rights
If you are a California resident, beginning on January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives you the following rights: 

Right to Know: You can ask us what personal data we hold about you and request a copy of the information. This information includes:

The categories of personal information we have collected about you.

The categories of sources from which we collect the personal information.

The business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information.

The categories of third parties with whom we share that information.

The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

Right to Delete: You can request that your personal information be erased. However, there are some exceptions to this right, in situations where we:

Need to complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service that you requested, or that is reasonably anticipated within our ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or to otherwise perform a contract between us. 

Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity.

Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.

Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.

Need to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.

Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer’s relationship with us.

Need to comply with a legal obligation.

Otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.

Right to Opt Out: Mariano Mejia does not sell any of your personal information for any purposes. 

The CCPA allows California residents to “opt out” of the sale of your personal information, and if you are under the age of 16, it gives you the right to “opt in” to any sale of your personal data. You can reach the opt out page by clicking here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.

Other Rights: In addition to the rights above, you also have the right to request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during the calendar year preceding your request. This request is free and may be made only once a year. 

You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights of California residents listed in this section.

If you would like to exercise any of the rights listed above, please follow the instructions in Section 6 below and contact us at the addresses below in the section entitled “How to contact us.” 

6. Data Requests – Verification Information Needed
Whether you’re making a data request under GDPR (Section 5) or CCPA (Section 6), we will need certain information in order to verify your identity and process a data request. Please provide your unique Advertising IDs for any device you’re using to play the game, along with the device type (Android or iOS) associated with each Advertising ID. 

You can find this as follows:

iOS: Currently, you can only access your Advertising ID on an iOS device by using a third party application. On your device, the ID will be called an “Identifier for Advertisers” or “IDFA”. There are a number of apps which perform this function on the App Store, but some common ones are:

AppsFlyer’s “My Device IDFA” - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-device-id-by-appsflyer-whitelist-test-device/id1192323960

Adjust’s “Adjust Insights” - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adjust-insights/id1125517808

TUNE’s “My TUNE Device” - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-tune-device/id1100377074

Android: On Android, your Advertising ID is known as the “Android Advertising Identifier” or the “Google Advertising ID.” On most Android devices, you can find this AAI/GAID in the Settings app on your device, under “Google”, then under “Ads.” It will be listed on the bottom of the screen. However, depending on your device, the specific location may vary. Please consult your device manufacturer for specific instructions on finding the AAI/GAID. Alternatively, you can download an application to access your AAI/GAID, such as AppsFlyer's "My Device ID" app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsflyer.android.deviceid 

7. Keeping your Personal Information secure
We have taken steps to put appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorized way. 

For example, we limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.

We use SSL encryption and other technologies to keep data safe when we transfer and store it.

8. How to complain
We hope that we can resolve any questions or concerns you raise about our use of your Personal Information. Please contact us via the methods listed below in the section entitled “How to contact us” to let us know about any of your questions or concerns, and we will get back to you to resolve the issue.

If you are an EU citizen, the General Data Protection Regulation also gives you right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred.
