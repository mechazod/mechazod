                    sign up for newsletters, make purchases, or use the Service. In addition, we may limit how we
                    collect, use, and store some of the information of EU users between 13 and 16. Mariano Mejia takes

                <h3>Right to Opt Out</h3>
                <p>Mariano Mejia does not sell any of your personal information for any purposes.</p>
                <p>The CCPA allows California residents to "opt out" of the sale of your personal information, and if
                    you are under the age of 16, it gives you the right to "opt in" to any sale of your personal data.
                    You can reach the opt out page by clicking here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</p>

                <h3>Other Rights</h3>

                    disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during
                    the calendar year preceding your request. This request is free and may be made only once a year.</p>
                <p>You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights of
                    California residents listed in this section.</p>

                <p>Whether you're making a data request under GDPR (Section 4) or CCPA (Section 5), we will need certain
                    information in order to verify your identity and process a data request. Please provide your unique
                    Advertising IDs for any device you're using to play the game, along with the device type (Android or
                    iOS) associated with each Advertising ID.</p>


                <h3>Android</h3>
                <p>On Android, your Advertising ID is known as the "Android Advertising Identifier" or the "Google
                    Advertising ID." On most Android devices, you can find this AAI/GAID in the Settings app on your
                    device, under "Google", then under "Ads." It will be listed on the bottom of the screen. However,
                    depending on your device, the specific location may vary. Please consult your device manufacturer
                    for specific instructions on finding the AAI/GAID. Alternatively, you can download an application to
                    access your AAI/GAID, such as AppsFlyer's "My Device ID" app: <a

                    and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do
